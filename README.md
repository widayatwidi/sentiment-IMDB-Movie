# sentiment-IMDB-Movie
A simple sentiment analysis with deep learning method - Assignment #05-W05-First Machine Learning Project - MLCC.

This sentiment analysis app use some packages :
<ul>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Keras</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Gensim - Word2Vec</li>
  <li>Matlotlib</li>
  <li>Glob</li>
</ul>

And use a Large Movie Review Dataset (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.
